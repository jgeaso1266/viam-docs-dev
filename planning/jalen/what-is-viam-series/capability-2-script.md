# Capability #2: Operate from Anywhere
## 60-Second Video Script

**Learning Outcome:** "I can access and control my robot remotely without networking configuration"

**Demo Setup:** Chess or Vino robot in office/lab, developer on laptop in different location (different network)

---

## Script

### [00:00-00:08] Hook (8 seconds)

*Visual:*
- Split screen or quick cut between two locations
- Robot in office/lab (one network)
- Developer with laptop at home/coffee shop (different network)

*Presenter:*
"Remote access to hardware usually means VPNs, port forwarding, SSH tunneling. Let me show you what happens when you skip all that."

---

### [00:08-00:22] Demo: Effortless Connection (14 seconds)

*Visual:*
- Laptop screen: Open browser
- Navigate to Viam app (or just show it opening)
- Robot appears in dashboard - online, ready
- No setup screens, no configuration dialogs
- Fast and clean

*Presenter (voiceover):*
"Open the browser. Robot's there. No setup, no configuration. Just connected."

*Optional visual overlay: Network diagram showing NAT/firewall between laptop and robot*

---

### [00:22-00:35] Demo: Live Feedback (13 seconds)

*Visual:*
- Click into robot
- Live camera feed starts streaming immediately
- Maybe show sensor readings updating in real-time
- Could show logs streaming (optional)
- Emphasize it's real-time, not cached

*Presenter (voiceover):*
"Live camera feed. Real-time data. Everything the robot sees, you see."

---

### [00:35-00:48] Demo: Bidirectional Control (13 seconds)

*Visual:*
- Send a control command (move arm, drive base, trigger action)
- Robot responds immediately
- Show both laptop screen (command sent) and robot moving
- Maybe show terminal/code running command remotely (alternative)

*Presenter (voiceover):*
"Send a command. Robot responds. Debug and control like it's localhost."

---

### [00:48-00:60] Payoff (12 seconds)

*Visual:*
- Back to presenter on camera
- Optional: Show network diagram emphasizing different networks/firewall

*Presenter:*
"No VPN. No port forwarding. No firewall rules. Remote access that just works, even across networks."

*Final beat - presenter gestures:*
"That's Viam."

## Production Notes

**Total time:** 60 seconds

**Pacing:**
- Hook establishes the typical pain (network config complexity)
- Connection demo should feel instant and effortless - that's the point
- Live feedback proves it's real-time, not simulated
- Control demo proves bidirectional communication - you can actually command the robot
- Payoff reinforces the "no configuration" message

**The narrative arc:**
Remote access is usually complicated → Open app, robot's there → See live data → Control it remotely → This is remote access without the hassle

**Key message:**
Remote robotics access is frictionless. Connect to robots like you connect to websites - no networking configuration needed.

**Critical moment:**
The instant connection (robot appears in app) OR the robot responding to remote command. Both prove the promise: effortless remote access and control.

## B-Roll Needed

- Robot in lab/office setting
- Developer with laptop in different location (home, coffee shop, or different room)
- Establishing shots showing physical separation
- Robot responding to commands (arm moving, base driving, action triggering)
- Optional: Network equipment (router, cables) to emphasize network separation

## Screen Recordings Needed

- Viam app login/dashboard (clean, fast)
- Robot appearing in dashboard (online status)
- Clicking into robot details
- Live camera feed starting/streaming
- Control interface (TEST panel or custom controls)
- Optional: Terminal showing code execution against remote robot
- Optional: Log streaming interface

## Graphics/Overlays

- Network diagram showing laptop and robot on different networks with NAT/firewall
- Location labels ("Home" / "Office" or "Network A" / "Network B")
- Clean transitions between laptop screen and robot shots
- Minimal, professional aesthetic
