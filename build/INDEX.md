# Build

*Task-oriented blocks — modular tutorials you compose.*

---

## Overview

Blocks are self-contained tutorials (~15-30 minutes each) that teach a specific capability. They're designed to be composed—complete the ones relevant to your project, skip the ones that aren't.

All blocks work in both simulation and real hardware.

## Block Categories

### [Foundation](../planning/block-definitions.md#foundation-blocks) 🔴
Start here. Every project needs these basics.
- Connect to Cloud
- Add a Camera
- Capture and Sync Data
- Basic Filtering
- Configure Data Pipelines
- Sync Data to Your Database
- Start Writing Code

### [Vision & Detection](../planning/block-definitions.md#vision-detection-blocks) 🔴
Understanding what the robot sees.
- Add Computer Vision
- Detect Objects (2D)
- Classify Objects
- Track Objects Across Frames
- Measure Depth
- Localize Objects in 3D

### [Stationary Vision](../planning/block-definitions.md#stationary-vision-blocks) 🔴
Vision systems that don't move.
- Trigger on Detection
- Count Objects
- Inspect for Defects
- Monitor Over Time

### [Mobile Base](../planning/block-definitions.md#mobile-base-blocks) 🔴
Robots that move.
- Drive the Base
- Estimate Position
- Build a Map
- Navigate to Waypoint
- Avoid Obstacles
- Follow a Patrol Route
- Detect While Moving
- Navigate to Detected Object
- Mobile Pick-and-Place

### [Arm + Manipulation](../planning/block-definitions.md#arm-manipulation-blocks) 🔴
Robots that grab things.
- Move the Arm
- Control Gripper
- Move to Pose
- Pick an Object
- Place an Object
- Pick from Bin
- Visual Servoing

## How to Use Blocks

**If you know what you need:** Jump directly to the relevant block.

**If you're following a work cell guide:** The guide will tell you which blocks to complete in order.

**If you're exploring:** Start with Foundation, then pick a track (Stationary Vision, Mobile Base, or Arm + Manipulation) based on your hardware.

---

## Prerequisites

Each block lists its prerequisites. Some blocks can be done in any order; others build on previous blocks.

## After Building

Once you've built your application, continue to:
- [Deploy](../deploy/INDEX.md) — Get it running in the real world
- [Scale](../scale/INDEX.md) — Go from one robot to many
- [Maintain](../maintain/INDEX.md) — Keep it running over time
