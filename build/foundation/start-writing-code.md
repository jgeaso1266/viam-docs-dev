## Overview

Write code on your laptop, run it against your robot over the network. No SSH, no file copying, no deploy step. Viam handles NAT traversal automatically—your code connects through firewalls without VPN configuration.

## What You'll Learn

- Connect to a remote robot from your development environment
- Run Python/Go code locally that controls remote hardware
- Iterate rapidly without deployment
- Transition from remote development to on-device execution when needed

## Prerequisites

- Connect to Cloud (completed)
- Add a Camera (completed)
- Capture and Sync Data (completed)
- Basic Filtering (completed)

## Problems Addressed

- 1.3: Writing initial control code
- 1.21: Slow iteration cycles
