# Basic Filtering

**Status:** 🔴 Placeholder

---

## Overview

Reduce bandwidth and storage costs by filtering data before sync. Sample at specified intervals or filter by sensor thresholds—no ML required.

## What You'll Learn

- Configure selective data capture rules
- Set time-based sampling intervals
- Filter by sensor thresholds (temperature, distance, etc.)
- Manage local storage on constrained devices

## Prerequisites

- Capture and Sync Data (completed)

## Problems Addressed

- 2.13: Deciding what data to capture
- 2.14: Data transfer to cloud (bandwidth management)
